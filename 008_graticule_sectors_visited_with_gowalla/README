Either checkins or stamps may be parsed. 

Press "More" several times and save checkins from (replace 'dudarev' with any other username)

    http://gowalla.com/users/dudarev
    Save to file checkins.html

Or save stamps (also pressing "More" as nessesary and replacing username)

    http://gowalla.com/users/dudarev/stamps
    Save to file stamps.html

In both cases unique places are found and placed into file

    stamps.json

Total number of stamps is printed at the end.
