The `source code`_ for the image above is a good place to reference creation of animated GIFs with Matplotlib (PNG images created with Matplotlib are combined with Imagemagick_). It is also a good place to see how a custom font may be used, and how one may get a bounding box coordinates for text in Matplotlib.
