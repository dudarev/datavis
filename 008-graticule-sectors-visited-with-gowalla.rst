**THIS IS A DRAFT**

People like to map places they visit. There is a number of services that help to create a map of visited countries |---| just google for '`map visited countries <http://www.google.com/search?q=map+visited+countries>`__'. In a global world the boundaries become less relevant, so it may be more fun to keep track of visits to another human abstraction, graticule sectors: parallels and meredians form a grid, one may choose sectors of one by one degree and record which were visited. (Idea by `@frestelse5117 <http://twitter.com/#!/frestelse5117>`__.)
